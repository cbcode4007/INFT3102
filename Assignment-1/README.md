Welcome to the source code repository for my portfolio!

Unfortunately, I could not find the time to host it as a proper site as of writing, but below are instructions for running it locally.

1. Obtain and extract the .zip file.
2. Navigate to the Assignment-1 directory.
3. Run 'npm run start' in the console.

Thank you for your patience and I hope your user experience is enjoyable!
